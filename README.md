#How to launch it

just like any other react app run the command "npm start"

note: because heroku does not allow files to be uploaded to a website hosted on it, upload functionality is not working though I am trying to resolve this issue by using google drive api and making it a replacement for the storage. at the moment however, it is what it is.
